# GRiD_Compass_1101_CCRPOM_source
Attempt to create GRiD Compass 1101 rev3 CCRPOM source code.

Initial disassembly was generetated with IDA 7.6 pro
Then it was translates to source code for Flat Assembler (fasmg)
fasmg is used because sometimes it is needed to tweak some op codes.


So far, source code can be compiled into binary exact Compass 1101 rev3 ROM dump.
