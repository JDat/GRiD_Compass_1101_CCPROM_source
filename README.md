# GRiD Compass CCPROM source
Attempt to create GRiD Compass CCPROM source code.

Initial disassembly was generetated with IDA 7.6 pro
Then it was translates to source code for Flat Assembler (fasmg)
fasmg is used because sometimes it is needed to tweak some op codes.


So far, source code can be compiled into binary exact Compass ROM dump.
Available ROM dumps and source code:

1101 Main board rev3 by usernameak + source code

1101 Main board rev4 by CM + source code

1109 by CM and Tomasz + source code

1129 by usernameak and Kirill

1139 by Klyball (also available on RuGRiD and vcfed forum)
